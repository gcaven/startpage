startpage
=========

Default new tab pages suck (especially Chrome's), so here's a better one.

###Features:
* time & date
* google search box
* categorized lists of my common web destinations
* randomized background images from Unsplash

###Future Work:
* google autocomplete/suggestions on the search box
* current weather
* a cached set of backgrounds to avoid the reduce loading times

###Very Future Work (probably require reimplementation as SPA):
* in place editing of link collections
* rss feed news preview (feedly account integration)
